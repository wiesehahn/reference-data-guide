  abstract = {Mapping forest extent and forest cover classification are important for the assessment of forest resources in socio-economic as well as ecological terms. Novel developments in the availability of remotely sensed data, computational resources, and advances in areas of statistical learning have enabled fusion of multi-sensor data, often yielding superior classification results. Most former studies of nemoral forests fusing multi-sensor and multi-temporal data have been limited in spatial extent and typically to a simple classification of landscapes into major land cover classes. We hypothesize that multi-temporal, multi-censor data will have a specific strength in further classification of nemoral forest landscapes owing to the distinct seasonal patterns of the phenology of broadleaves. This study aimed to classify the Danish landscape into forest/non-forest and further into forest types (broadleaved/coniferous) and species groups, using a cloud-based approach based on multi-temporal Sentinel 1 and 2 data and machine learning (random forest) trained with National Forest Inventory (NFI) data. Mapping of non-forest and forest resulted in producer accuracies of 99\% and 90 \%, respectively. The mapping of forest types (broadleaf and conifer) within the forested area resulted in producer accuracies of 95\% for conifer and 96\% for broadleaf forest. Tree species groups were classified with producer accuracies ranging 34-74\%. Species groups with coniferous species were the least confused whereas the broadleaf groups, especially Oak, had higher error rates. The results are applied in Danish National accounting of greenhouse gas emissions from forests, resource assessment and assessment of forest biodiversity potentials.},

  abstract = {Accurate information regarding forest tree species composition is useful for a wide range of applications, both for forest management and scientific research. Remote sensing is an efficient tool for collecting spatially explicit information on forest attributes. With the launch of the Sentinel-2 mission, new opportunities have arisen for mapping tree species owing to its spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution. The short revisit cycle (five days) is crucial in vegetation mapping because of the reflectance changes caused by phenological phases. In our study, we evaluated the utility of the Sentinel-2 time series for mapping tree species in the complex, mixed forests of the Polish Carpathian Mountains. We mapped the following nine tree species: common beech, silver birch, common hornbeam, silver fir, sycamore maple, European larch, grey alder, Scots pine, and Norway spruce. We used the Sentinel-2 time series from 2018, with 18 images included in the study. Different combinations of Sentinel-2 imagery were selected based on mean decrease accuracy (MDA) and mean decrease Gini (MDG) measures, in addition to temporal phonological pattern analysis. Tree species discrimination was performed using the Random Forest classification algorithm. Our results showed that the use of the Sentinel-2 time series instead of single date imagery significantly improved forest tree species mapping, by approximately 5\textendash 10\% of overall accuracy. In particular, combining images from spring and autumn resulted in better species discrimination.},

  abstract = {There are a limited number of studies addressing the forest status, its extent, location, type and composition over a larger area at the regional or national levels. The dense time series and a wide swath of Sentinel-2 data are a good basis for forest mapping and tree species identification over a large area. This study presents the results of the classification of the forest/non-forest cover, forest type (broadleaf and coniferous) and the identification of eight tree species (beech, oak, alder, birch, spruce, pine, fir, and larch) using the multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data in combination with topographic information. The study was conducted over the large mountain area located in southern Poland. The Random Forest classifier was used to first derive a forest/non-forest map. Second, the forest was classified into broadleaf and coniferous. Finally, the tree species classification was carried out following two approaches: (i) Non-stratified, where all species were classified together within the forest mask and (ii) stratified, where the broadleaf and coniferous tree species were classified separately within the forest type masks. The overall accuracy for the forest/non-forest cover reached 98.3\% and declined slightly to 94.8\% for the classification of the forest type. The use of the topographic information did not increase the accuracy of either result. The role of the topographic variables increased significantly in the process of tree species delineation. By combining the topographic information (in particular, digital elevation model) with the multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data, the classification of eight tree species improved from 75.6\% to 81.7\% (approach 1). A further increase in accuracy to 89.5\% for broadleaf and 82\% for coniferous species was observed following the stratified approach number 2. The highest overall accuracy (above 85\%) was obtained for beech, oak, birch, alder, and larch. The study confirmed the potential of the multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data for accurate delineation of the forest cover, forest type, and tree species at the regional scale.},

  abstract = {The most recent forest-type map of the Korean Peninsula was produced in 1910. That of South Korea alone was produced since 1972; however, the forest type information of North Korea, which is an inaccessible region, is not known due to the separation after the Korean War. In this study, we developed a model to classify the five dominant tree species in North Korea (Korean red pine, Korean pine, Japanese larch, needle fir, and Oak) using satellite data and machine-learning techniques. The model was applied to the Gwangneung Forest area in South Korea; the Mt. Baekdu area of China, which borders North Korea; and to Goseong-gun, at the border of South Korea and North Korea, to evaluate the model\&rsquo;s applicability to North Korea. Eighty-three percent accuracy was achieved in the classification of the Gwangneung Forest area. In classifying forest types in the Mt. Baekdu area and Goseong-gun, even higher accuracies of 91\% and 90\% were achieved, respectively. These results confirm the model\&rsquo;s regional applicability. To expand the model for application to North Korea, a new model was developed by integrating training data from the three study areas. The integrated model\&rsquo;s classification of forest types in Goseong-gun (South Korea) was relatively accurate (80\%); thus, the model was utilized to produce a map of the predicted dominant tree species in Goseong-gun (North Korea).},

  abstract = {The Sentinel-2 program provides the opportunity to monitor terrestrial ecosystems with a high temporal and spectral resolution. In this study, a multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data set was used to classify common tree species over a mature forest in central Sweden. The tree species to be classified were Norway spruce (Picea abies), Scots pine (Pinus silvestris), Hybrid larch (Larix \texttimes{} marschlinsii), Birch (Betula sp.) and Pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). Four Sentinel-2 images from spring (7 April and 27 May), summer (9 July) and fall (19 October) of 2017 were used along with the Random Forest (RF) classifier. A variable selection approach was implemented to find fewer and uncorrelated bands resulting in the best model for tree species identification. The final model resulting in the highest overall accuracy (88.2\%) came from using all bands from the four image dates. The single image that gave the most accurate classification result (80.5\%) was the late spring image (27 May); the 27 May image was always included in subsequent image combinations that gave the highest overall accuracy. The five tree species were classified with a user's accuracy ranging from 70.9\% to 95.6\%. Thirteen of the 40 bands were selected in a variable selection procedure and resulted in a model with only slightly lower accuracy (86.3\%) than that using all bands. Among the highest ranked bands were the red edge bands 2 and 3 as well as the narrow NIR (near-infrared) band 8a, all from the 27 May image, and SWIR (short-wave infrared) bands from all four image dates. This study shows that the red-edge bands and SWIR bands from Sentinel-2 are of importance, and confirms that spring and/or fall images capturing phenological differences between the species are most useful to tree species classification.},

Atmospheric correction was applied to the level 1C data, resulting in true surface reflectance or bottom of atmosphere (BOA) output. We developed a semiautomatic workflow for the classification of deciduous (mainly spruce trees), beech and oak trees by evaluating different classification algorithms (object- and pixel-based) in an architecture optimized for distributed processing. A hierarchical approach was used to evaluate different band combinations and algorithms (Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF)) for the separation of broad-leaved vs. coniferous trees. The Ebersberger forest was the main project region and the Freisinger forest was used in a transferability study. Accuracy assessment and training of the algorithms was based on inventory data, validation was conducted using an independent dataset. A confusion matrix, with User\textasciiacute s and Producer\textasciiacute s Accuracies, as well as Overall Accuracies, was created for all analyses. In total, we tested 16 different classification setups for coniferous vs. broad-leaved trees, achieving the best performance of 97\% for an object-based multitemporal SVM approach using only band 8 from three scenes (May, August and September). For the separation of beech and oak trees we evaluated 54 different setups, the best result achieved an accuracy of 91\% for an object-based, SVM, multitemporal approach using bands 8, 2 and 3 of the May scene for segmentation and all principal components of the August scene for classification. The transferability of the model was tested for the Freisinger forest and showed similar results. This project points out that Sentinel-2 had only marginally worse results than comparable commercial high-resolution satellite sensors and is well-suited for forest analysis on a tree-stand level.},

  abstract = {Optical satellite imagery with high temporal and spatial resolution, such as acquired by Sentinel-2, is increasingly becoming available and is used to derive maps of tree species. Such mapping products are required in the scope of operational and sustainable forest management. Existing studies that employ Sentinel-2 imagery have already evaluated different classification algorithms but are often confined to areas smaller than a single Sentinel-2 scene. In this study, the area of interest (a large part of the Province of Tyrol (Austria)) is covered by two Sentinel-2 tiles, of which approximately 5000 kmÂ² are forested. In order to deal with seasonal metrics under recurrent cloud cover conditions, we exploit one year of Sentinel-2 imagery by using land surface phenology (LSP) and seasonal cloud-free composites for mapping five different tree species groups (Broadleaved-, Larch- (Larix), Pine- (Pinus), Dwarf Pine- (Pinus mugo) and Spruce/Fir (Abies alba/Picea abies) stands). Although a regular multitemporal classification setup based on three cloud-free images reached an overall accuracy of around 84.4 \% and outperformed monotemporal setups by around 10 \% points, the availability of single cloud-free images was limited in the mountainous region. Thus, alternative approaches, using combined measures for the entire time series of Sentinel-2 imagery, i.e. three-monthly temporal reflectance composites and phenological metrics, were tested and could even improve overall accuracy by 1â€“2 \% points. As a conclusion, we agree with previous studies that multitemporal imagery can help improving the mapping accuracy. However, leveraging satellite image time series for large-scale mapping of tree species should not only rely on high-quality cloud-free single images and should strongly be supported by i.e. seasonal composites or multi-image metrics. Therefore, development and provisioning of such datasets should be fostered.},

The accuracies of the best model ranged between 74\% for spruce and 87\% for deciduous forest. An overall accuracy of 90\% was found on stand level using independent data from more than 42.000 stands. Errors mostly resulting from a forest mask reduced the model accuracies by approximately 10\%. Nonetheless, efficiencies of national forest area estimates increased by 20\% to 50\% for model-assisted (MA) estimates and up to 90\% for poststratification (PS). Greater minimum number of observations, however, constrained the use of PS. For estimates of sub-populations (municipalities), efficiencies improved by up to a factor of 8. However, even for municipalities with a decent number of NFI plots, direct NFI estimates were sometimes more precise than MA estimates. PS estimates were always more precise than direct and MA estimates but were applicable in fewer municipalities. The tree species prediction map is freely available as part of the Norwegian forest resource map and is used, among others, to improve maps of other variables of interest such as timber volume and biomass.},

Class memberships, which estimate the proportion of each class for every pixel, have been suggested as an alternative. This paper compares different strategies of training data allocation for discrete and continuous land cover mapping using classification and regression tree algorithms. In addition to measures of discrete and continuous map accuracy the correct estimation of the area is another important criteria. A subset of the 30 m national land cover dataset of 2006 (NLCD2006) of the United States was used as reference set to classify NADIR BRDF-adjusted surface reflectance time series of MODIS at 900 m spatial resolution. Results show that sampling of heterogeneous pixels and sample allocation according to the expected area of each class is best for classification trees. Regression trees for continuous land cover mapping should be trained with random allocation, and predictions should be normalized with a linear scaling function to correctly estimate the total area. From the tested algorithms random forest classification yields lower errors than boosted trees of C5.0, and Cubist shows higher accuracies than random forest regression.},

In this paper, we compare two basic strategies for dealing with data that has a skewed class distribution and non-uniform misclassification costs. One strategy is based on cost-sensitive learning while the other strategy employs sampling to create a more balanced class distribution in the training set. We compare two sampling techniques, up-sampling and down-sampling, to the cost-sensitive learning approach.

  abstract = {Studies have demonstrated the robust performance of the ensemble machine learning classifier, random forests, for remote sensing land cover classification, particularly across complex landscapes. This study introduces new ensemble margin criteria to evaluate the performance of Random Forests (RF) in the context of large area land cover classification and examines the effect of different training data characteristics (imbalance and mislabelling) on classification accuracy and uncertainty. The study presents a new margin weighted confusion matrix, which used in combination with the traditional confusion matrix, provides confidence estimates associated with correctly and misclassified instances in the RF classification model. Landsat TM satellite imagery, topographic and climate ancillary data are used to build binary (forest/non-forest) and multiclass (forest canopy cover classes) classification models, trained using sample aerial photograph maps, across Victoria, Australia. Experiments were undertaken to reveal insights into the behaviour of RF over large and complex data, in which training data are not evenly distributed among classes (imbalance) and contain systematically mislabelled instances. Results of experiments reveal that while the error rate of the RF classifier is relatively insensitive to mislabelled training data (in the multiclass experiment, overall 78.3\% Kappa with no mislabelled instances to 70.1\% with 25\% mislabelling in each class), the level of associated confidence falls at a faster rate than overall accuracy with increasing amounts of mislabelled training data. In general, balanced training data resulted in the lowest overall error rates for classification experiments (82.3\% and 78.3\% for the binary and multiclass experiments respectively). However, results of the study demonstrate that imbalance can be introduced to improve error rates of more difficult classes, without adversely affecting overall classification accuracy.

  abstract = {Random Forest (RF) is a widely used algorithm for classification of remotely sensed data. Through a case study in peatland classification using LiDAR derivatives, we present an analysis of the effects of input data characteristics on RF classifications (including RF out-ofbag error, independent classification accuracy and class proportion error). Training data selection and specific input variables (i.e., image channels) have a large impact on the overall accuracy of the image classification. High-dimension datasets should be reduced so that only uncorrelated important variables are used in classifications. Despite the fact that RF is an ensemble approach, independent error assessments should be used to evaluate RF results, and iterative classifications are recommended to assess the stability of predicted classes. Results are also shown to be highly sensitive to the size of the training data set. In addition to being as large as possible, the training data sets used in RF classification should also be (a) randomly distributed or created in a manner that allows for the class proportions of the training data to be representative of actual class proportions in the landscape; and (b) should have minimal spatial autocorrelation to improve classification results and to mitigate inflated estimates of RF out-of-bag classification accuracy.},

  abstract = {In this paper we propose two ways to deal with the imbalanced data classification problem using random forest. One is based on cost sensitive learning, and the other is based on a sampling technique. Performance metrics such as precision and recall, false positive rate and false negative rate, F-measure and weighted accuracy are computed. Both methods are shown to improve the prediction accuracy of the minority class, and have favorable performance compared to the existing algorithms.},
