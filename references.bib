  abstract = {Mapping forest extent and forest cover classification are important for the assessment of forest resources in socio-economic as well as ecological terms. Novel developments in the availability of remotely sensed data, computational resources, and advances in areas of statistical learning have enabled fusion of multi-sensor data, often yielding superior classification results. Most former studies of nemoral forests fusing multi-sensor and multi-temporal data have been limited in spatial extent and typically to a simple classification of landscapes into major land cover classes. We hypothesize that multi-temporal, multi-censor data will have a specific strength in further classification of nemoral forest landscapes owing to the distinct seasonal patterns of the phenology of broadleaves. This study aimed to classify the Danish landscape into forest/non-forest and further into forest types (broadleaved/coniferous) and species groups, using a cloud-based approach based on multi-temporal Sentinel 1 and 2 data and machine learning (random forest) trained with National Forest Inventory (NFI) data. Mapping of non-forest and forest resulted in producer accuracies of 99\% and 90 \%, respectively. The mapping of forest types (broadleaf and conifer) within the forested area resulted in producer accuracies of 95\% for conifer and 96\% for broadleaf forest. Tree species groups were classified with producer accuracies ranging 34-74\%. Species groups with coniferous species were the least confused whereas the broadleaf groups, especially Oak, had higher error rates. The results are applied in Danish National accounting of greenhouse gas emissions from forests, resource assessment and assessment of forest biodiversity potentials.},

The accuracies of the best model ranged between 74\% for spruce and 87\% for deciduous forest. An overall accuracy of 90\% was found on stand level using independent data from more than 42.000 stands. Errors mostly resulting from a forest mask reduced the model accuracies by approximately 10\%. Nonetheless, efficiencies of national forest area estimates increased by 20\% to 50\% for model-assisted (MA) estimates and up to 90\% for poststratification (PS). Greater minimum number of observations, however, constrained the use of PS. For estimates of sub-populations (municipalities), efficiencies improved by up to a factor of 8. However, even for municipalities with a decent number of NFI plots, direct NFI estimates were sometimes more precise than MA estimates. PS estimates were always more precise than direct and MA estimates but were applicable in fewer municipalities. The tree species prediction map is freely available as part of the Norwegian forest resource map and is used, among others, to improve maps of other variables of interest such as timber volume and biomass.},

Class memberships, which estimate the proportion of each class for every pixel, have been suggested as an alternative. This paper compares different strategies of training data allocation for discrete and continuous land cover mapping using classification and regression tree algorithms. In addition to measures of discrete and continuous map accuracy the correct estimation of the area is another important criteria. A subset of the 30 m national land cover dataset of 2006 (NLCD2006) of the United States was used as reference set to classify NADIR BRDF-adjusted surface reflectance time series of MODIS at 900 m spatial resolution. Results show that sampling of heterogeneous pixels and sample allocation according to the expected area of each class is best for classification trees. Regression trees for continuous land cover mapping should be trained with random allocation, and predictions should be normalized with a linear scaling function to correctly estimate the total area. From the tested algorithms random forest classification yields lower errors than boosted trees of C5.0, and Cubist shows higher accuracies than random forest regression.},

  abstract = {Ensemble learning is a powerful tool that has shown promise when applied towards bioinformatics datasets. In particular, the Random Forest classifier has been an effective and popular algorithm due to its relatively good classification performance and its ease of use. However, Random Forest does not account for class imbalance which is known for decreasing classification performance and increasing bias towards the majority class. In this study, we seek to determine if the inclusion of data sampling will improve the performance of the Random Forest classifier. In order to test the effect of data sampling, we used Random Undersampling along with two post-sampling class distribution ratios: 35:65 and 50:50 (minority:majority). Additionally, we also built inductive models with Random Forest when no data sampling technique was applied, so we can observe the true effect of the data sampling. All three options were tested on a series of fifteen imbalanced bioinformatics datasets. Our results show that data sampling does improve the classification performance of Random Forest, especially when using the 50:50 post-sampling class distribution ratio. However, statistical analysis shows that the increase in performance is not statistically significant. Thus, we can state that while data sampling does improve the classification performance of Random Forest, it is not a necessary step as the classifier is fairly robust to imbalanced data on its own.},

Here we present a novel approach for mapping individual tree species based on ensemble modeling, i.e. combining the projections of several modeling techniques in order to reduce uncertainty. Using statistical modeling in conjunction with high-resolution aerial imagery (50cm spatial resolution) and topo-climatic variables (5m spatial resolution), we map the distributions of six major tree species (3 broadleaf and 3 conifers) in a study area of North-Eastern Switzerland. We also compare the relative predictive power of both topo-climatic and remote-sensing variables for mapping the spatial tree patterns and assess the importance of calibration data quality on model performance. We evaluate our projections using cross-validation as well as with independent data. Overall, the evaluations that we obtain for our vegetation maps are in line with, or higher than, those in similar studies. Depending on the considered tree species, 47.8\textendash 85.6\% of our samples were correctly predicted, and we obtain an overall CCR (correct classification rate) of 0.72 and a Cohen's kappa of 0.65. Comparing the predictive power of the different modeling techniques, we find that ensemble modeling (i.e. combining the projections of different individual modeling techniques) generally performs better than individual modeling techniques.},

Knowledge on tree species is relevant for biomass estimation, habitat quality assessment, and biodiversity characterization. Hyperspectral data have been proven to have a high potential for the mapping of tree species composition. However, open questions remain concerning the robustness of existing classification approaches. Here, a number of classification approaches were compared to classify tree species from airborne hyperspectral data across three forest sites to identify a single approach which continuously delivers high classification performances over all test sites. Examined approaches included three feature selection methods [genetic algorithm (GA), support vector machines (SVM) wrapper, and sparse generalized partial least squares selection (PLS)] each combined with two nonparametric classifiers (SVM and Random Forest). Two further setups included classifications applied to the full hyperspectral dataset and to an image transformed with a minimum noise fraction (MNF) transformation. Results showed that SVM wrapper and the GA slightly outperformed the PLS-based algorithm. In most cases, the best classification runs involving a feature selection algorithm outperformed those incorporating the full hyperspectral dataset. However, the best overall results were obtained when using the first 10-20 components of the MNF-transformed image. Selected bands were frequently located in the visual region close to the green peak, at the chlorophyll absorption feature and the red edge rise as well as in three parts of the short-wave infrared region close to water absorption features. These findings are relevant for improving the robustness of tree species classifications from airborne hyperspectral data incorporating feature reduction techniques.},

Remote sensing is an efficient tool for collecting spatially explicit information on forest attributes. With the launch of the Sentinel-2 mission, new opportunities have arisen for mapping tree species owing to its spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution. The short revisit cycle (five days) is crucial in vegetation mapping because of the reflectance changes caused by phenological phases. In our study, we evaluated the utility of the Sentinel-2 time series for mapping tree species in the complex, mixed forests of the Polish Carpathian Mountains. We mapped the following nine tree species: common beech, silver birch, common hornbeam, silver fir, sycamore maple, European larch, grey alder, Scots pine, and Norway spruce. We used the Sentinel-2 time series from 2018, with 18 images included in the study. Different combinations of Sentinel-2 imagery were selected based on mean decrease accuracy (MDA) and mean decrease Gini (MDG) measures, in addition to temporal phonological pattern analysis. Tree species discrimination was performed using the Random Forest classification algorithm. Our results showed that the use of the Sentinel-2 time series instead of single date imagery significantly improved forest tree species mapping, by approximately 5\textendash 10\% of overall accuracy. In particular, combining images from spring and autumn resulted in better species discrimination.},

The dense time series and a wide swath of Sentinel-2 data are a good basis for forest mapping and tree species identification over a large area. This study presents the results of the classification of the forest/non-forest cover, forest type (broadleaf and coniferous) and the identification of eight tree species (beech, oak, alder, birch, spruce, pine, fir, and larch) using the multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data in combination with topographic information. The study was conducted over the large mountain area located in southern Poland. The Random Forest classifier was used to first derive a forest/non-forest map. Second, the forest was classified into broadleaf and coniferous. Finally, the tree species classification was carried out following two approaches: (i) Non-stratified, where all species were classified together within the forest mask and (ii) stratified, where the broadleaf and coniferous tree species were classified separately within the forest type masks. The overall accuracy for the forest/non-forest cover reached 98.3\% and declined slightly to 94.8\% for the classification of the forest type. The use of the topographic information did not increase the accuracy of either result. The role of the topographic variables increased significantly in the process of tree species delineation. By combining the topographic information (in particular, digital elevation model) with the multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data, the classification of eight tree species improved from 75.6\% to 81.7\% (approach 1). A further increase in accuracy to 89.5\% for broadleaf and 82\% for coniferous species was observed following the stratified approach number 2. The highest overall accuracy (above 85\%) was obtained for beech, oak, birch, alder, and larch. The study confirmed the potential of the multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data for accurate delineation of the forest cover, forest type, and tree species at the regional scale.},

We examined the impact of training sample selection on a binary classification of urban and nonurban for the Denver, Colorado, metropolitan area. Complete coverage reference data for urban and nonurban cover were available for the year 1997, which allowed us to examine variability in accuracy of the classification over multiple repetitions of the training sample selection and classification process. Four sampling designs for selecting training data were evaluated. These designs represented two options for stratification (spatial and class-specific) and two options for sample allocation (proportional to area and equal allocation). The binary urban and nonurban classification was obtained by employing a decision tree classifier with Landsat imagery. The decision tree classifier was applied to 1000 training samples selected by each of the four training data sampling designs, and accuracy for each classification was derived using the complete coverage reference data. The allocation of sample size to the two classes had a greater effect on classifier performance than the spatial distribution of the training data. The choice of proportional or equal allocation depends on which accuracy objectives have higher priority for a given application. For example, proportionally allocating the training sample to urban and nonurban classes favoured user's accuracy of urban whereas equally allocating the training sample to the two classes favoured producer's accuracy of urban. Although this study focused on urban and nonurban classes, the results and conclusions likely generalize to any binary classification in which the two classes represent disproportionate areas.},

In this respect, the use of deep learning methods is trend-setting, enabling high predictive accuracy, while learning the relevant data features independently in an end-to-end fashion. Very recently, a series of studies have demonstrated that the deep learning method of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is very effective to represent spatial patterns enabling to extract a wide array of vegetation properties from remote sensing imagery. This review introduces the principles of CNN and distils why they are particularly suitable for vegetation remote sensing. The main part synthesizes current trends and developments, including considerations about spectral resolution, spatial grain, different sensors types, modes of reference data generation, sources of existing reference data, as well as CNN approaches and architectures. The literature review showed that CNN can be applied to various problems, including the detection of individual plants or the pixel-wise segmentation of vegetation classes, while numerous studies have evinced that CNN outperform shallow machine learning methods. Several studies suggest that the ability of CNN to exploit spatial patterns particularly facilitates the value of very high 1 spatial resolution data. The modularity in the common deep learning frameworks allows a high flexibility for the adaptation of architec-tures, whereby especially multi-modal or multi-temporal applications can benefit. An increasing availability of techniques for visualizing features learned by CNNs will not only contribute to interpret but to learn from such models and improve our understanding of remotely sensed signals of vegetation. Although CNN has not been around for long, it seems obvious that they will usher in a new era of vegetation remote sensing.},

  abstract = {Optical satellite imagery with high temporal and spatial resolution, such as acquired by Sentinel-2, is increasingly becoming available and is used to derive maps of tree species. Such mapping products are required in the scope of operational and sustainable forest management. Existing studies that employ Sentinel-2 imagery have already evaluated different classification algorithms but are often confined to areas smaller than a single Sentinel-2 scene. In this study, the area of interest (a large part of the Province of Tyrol (Austria)) is covered by two Sentinel-2 tiles, of which approximately 5000 km{$^2$} are forested. In order to deal with seasonal metrics under recurrent cloud cover conditions, we exploit one year of Sentinel-2 imagery by using land surface phenology (LSP) and seasonal cloud-free composites for mapping five different tree species groups (Broadleaved-, Larch- (Larix), Pine- (Pinus), Dwarf Pine- (Pinus mugo) and Spruce/Fir (Abies alba/Picea abies) stands). Although a regular multitemporal classification setup based on three cloud-free images reached an overall accuracy of around 84.4 \% and outperformed monotemporal setups by around 10 \% points, the availability of single cloud-free images was limited in the mountainous region. Thus, alternative approaches, using combined measures for the entire time series of Sentinel-2 imagery, i.e. three-monthly temporal reflectance composites and phenological metrics, were tested and could even improve overall accuracy by 1\textendash 2 \% points. As a conclusion, we agree with previous studies that multitemporal imagery can help improving the mapping accuracy. However, leveraging satellite image time series for large-scale mapping of tree species should not only rely on high-quality cloud-free single images and should strongly be supported by i.e. seasonal composites or multi-image metrics. Therefore, development and provisioning of such datasets should be fostered.},

  abstract = {The inventory of woody vegetation is of great importance for good forest management. Advancements of remote sensing techniques have provided excellent tools for such purposes, reducing the required amount of time and labor, yet with high accuracy and the information richness. Sentinel-2 is one of the relatively new satellite missions, whose 13 spectral bands and short revisit time proved to be very useful when it comes to forest monitoring. In this study, the novel spatio-temporal classification framework for mapping woody vegetation from Sentinel-2 multitemporal data has been proposed. The used framework is based on the probability random forest classification, where temporal information is explicitly defined in the model. Because of this, several predictions are made for each pixel of the study area, which allow for specific spatio-temporal aggregation to be performed. The proposed methodology has been successfully applied for mapping eight potential forest and shrubby vegetation types over the study area of Serbia. Several spatio-temporal aggregation approaches have been tested, divided into two main groups: pixel-based and neighborhood-based. The validation metrics show that determining the most common vegetation type classes in the neighborhood of 5 \&times; 5 pixels provides the best results. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient obtained from five-fold cross validation of the results are 82.97\% and 0.75, respectively. The corresponding producer\&rsquo;s accuracies range from 36.74\% to 97.99\% and user\&rsquo;s accuracies range from 46.31\% to 98.43\%. The proposed methodology proved to be applicable for mapping woody vegetation in Serbia and shows a potential to be implemented in other areas as well. Further testing is necessary to confirm such assumptions.},

Starting as a problem of skewed distributions of binary tasks, this topic evolved way beyond this conception. With the expansion of machine learning and data mining, combined with the arrival of big data era, we have gained a deeper insight into the nature of imbalanced learning, while at the same time facing new emerging challenges. Data-level and algorithm-level methods are constantly being improved and hybrid approaches gain increasing popularity. Recent trends focus on analyzing not only the disproportion between classes, but also other difficulties embedded in the nature of data. New real-life problems motivate researchers to focus on computationally efficient, adaptive and real-time methods. This paper aims at discussing open issues and challenges that need to be addressed to further develop the field of imbalanced learning. Seven vital areas of research in this topic are identified, covering the full spectrum of learning from imbalanced data: classification, regression, clustering, data streams, big data analytics and applications, e.g., in social media and computer vision. This paper provides a discussion and suggestions concerning lines of future research for each of them.},

That of South Korea alone was produced since 1972; however, the forest type information of North Korea, which is an inaccessible region, is not known due to the separation after the Korean War. In this study, we developed a model to classify the five dominant tree species in North Korea (Korean red pine, Korean pine, Japanese larch, needle fir, and Oak) using satellite data and machine-learning techniques. The model was applied to the Gwangneung Forest area in South Korea; the Mt. Baekdu area of China, which borders North Korea; and to Goseong-gun, at the border of South Korea and North Korea, to evaluate the model\&rsquo;s applicability to North Korea. Eighty-three percent accuracy was achieved in the classification of the Gwangneung Forest area. In classifying forest types in the Mt. Baekdu area and Goseong-gun, even higher accuracies of 91\% and 90\% were achieved, respectively. These results confirm the model\&rsquo;s regional applicability. To expand the model for application to North Korea, a new model was developed by integrating training data from the three study areas. The integrated model\&rsquo;s classification of forest types in Goseong-gun (South Korea) was relatively accurate (80\%); thus, the model was utilized to produce a map of the predicted dominant tree species in Goseong-gun (North Korea).},

In many instances, such as for medical diagnosis, the minority class is the class of primary interest and hence this classification behavior is unacceptable. In this paper, we compare two basic strategies for dealing with data that has a skewed class distribution and non-uniform misclassification costs. One strategy is based on cost-sensitive learning while the other strategy employs sampling to create a more balanced class distribution in the training set. We compare two sampling techniques, up-sampling and down-sampling, to the cost-sensitive learning approach.

  abstract = {Studies have demonstrated the robust performance of the ensemble machine learning classifier, random forests, for remote sensing land cover classification, particularly across complex landscapes. This study introduces new ensemble margin criteria to evaluate the performance of Random Forests (RF) in the context of large area land cover classification and examines the effect of different training data characteristics (imbalance and mislabelling) on classification accuracy and uncertainty. The study presents a new margin weighted confusion matrix, which used in combination with the traditional confusion matrix, provides confidence estimates associated with correctly and misclassified instances in the RF classification model. Landsat TM satellite imagery, topographic and climate ancillary data are used to build binary (forest/non-forest) and multiclass (forest canopy cover classes) classification models, trained using sample aerial photograph maps, across Victoria, Australia. Experiments were undertaken to reveal insights into the behaviour of RF over large and complex data, in which training data are not evenly distributed among classes (imbalance) and contain systematically mislabelled instances. Results of experiments reveal that while the error rate of the RF classifier is relatively insensitive to mislabelled training data (in the multiclass experiment, overall 78.3\% Kappa with no mislabelled instances to 70.1\% with 25\% mislabelling in each class), the level of associated confidence falls at a faster rate than overall accuracy with increasing amounts of mislabelled training data. In general, balanced training data resulted in the lowest overall error rates for classification experiments (82.3\% and 78.3\% for the binary and multiclass experiments respectively). However, results of the study demonstrate that imbalance can be introduced to improve error rates of more difficult classes, without adversely affecting overall classification accuracy. \'O 2015 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Through a case study in peatland classification using LiDAR derivatives, we present an analysis of the effects of input data characteristics on RF classifications (including RF out-ofbag error, independent classification accuracy and class proportion error). Training data selection and specific input variables (i.e., image channels) have a large impact on the overall accuracy of the image classification. High-dimension datasets should be reduced so that only uncorrelated important variables are used in classifications. Despite the fact that RF is an ensemble approach, independent error assessments should be used to evaluate RF results, and iterative classifications are recommended to assess the stability of predicted classes. Results are also shown to be highly sensitive to the size of the training data set. In addition to being as large as possible, the training data sets used in RF classification should also be (a) randomly distributed or created in a manner that allows for the class proportions of the training data to be representative of actual class proportions in the landscape; and (b) should have minimal spatial autocorrelation to improve classification results and to mitigate inflated estimates of RF out-of-bag classification accuracy.},

There is the enormous increment of data generation and imbalance within dataset. Processing and knowledge extraction of huge amount of imbalanced data becomes a challenge related with space and time necessities. Generally there is a list of an assortment of factual humanity applications which deals with unequal data sample division in to number of classes. Due to this division of data either of class goes into majority or minority with comparably less data count. This outnumbering of data sample in either of one class directs towards the handling of minority class and target on remarkable reduction in error rate. The standard learning methods do not directly focus on this type of classes. Random Forest Classification (RFC) is an ensemble approach that utilizes a number of classifiers to work together in order to identify the class label for unlabeled instances. This approach has proved its high accuracy and superiority with imbalanced datasets. This classifier provides various techniques to resolve class imbalance problem. This paper summarizes, the literature survey from 2000 to 2016 of various techniques related to RFC to resolve class imbalance. Specifically Weighted Random Forest (WRF), Balanced Random Forest (BRF), Sampling (Under Sampling (US)) and Down Sampling (DS), Cost Sensitive Methods have been adapted more to till date. The limitation of this numerous literature is researchers can focus on dynamic integration techniques to resolve class imbalance and increase robustness and versatility of classification.},

Although standard Machine Learning (ML) classifiers can achieve high accuracies for majority classes, they largely fail to provide reasonable accuracies for minority classes. This is mainly due to the class imbalance problem. In this study, a hybrid data balancing method, called the Partial Random Over-Sampling and Random Under-Sampling (PROSRUS), was proposed to resolve the class imbalance issue. Unlike most data balancing techniques which seek to fully balance datasets, PROSRUS uses a partial balancing approach with hundreds of fractions for majority and minority classes to balance datasets. For this, time-series of Landsat-8 and SRTM topographic data along with various spectral indices and topographic data were used over three mountainous sites within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. It was observed that PROSRUS had better performance than several other balancing methods and increased the accuracy of minority classes without a reduction in overall classification accuracy. Furthermore, adopting complementary information, particularly topographic data, considerably increased the accuracy of minority classes in mountainous areas. Finally, the obtained results from PROSRUS indicated that every imbalanced dataset requires a specific fraction(s) for addressing the class imbalance problem, because different datasets contain various characteristics.},

We provide practitioners with a set of ``good practice'' recommendations for designing and implementing an accuracy assessment of a change map and estimating area based on the reference sample data. The good practice recommendations address the three major components: sampling design, response design and analysis. The primary good practice recommendations for assessing accuracy and estimating area are: (i) implement a probability sampling design that is chosen to achieve the priority objectives of accuracy and area estimation while also satisfying practical constraints such as cost and available sources of reference data; (ii) implement a response design protocol that is based on reference data sources that provide sufficient spatial and temporal representation to accurately label each unit in the sample (i.e., the ``reference classification'' will be considerably more accurate than the map classification being evaluated); (iii) implement an analysis that is consistent with the sampling design and response design protocols; (iv) summarize the accuracy assessment by reporting the estimated error matrix in terms of proportion of area and estimates of overall accuracy, user's accuracy (or commission error), and producer's accuracy (or omission error); (v) estimate area of classes (e.g., types of change such as wetland loss or types of persistence such as stable forest) based on the reference classification of the sample units; (vi) quantify uncertainty by reporting confidence intervals for accuracy and area parameters; (vii) evaluate variability and potential error in the reference classification; and (viii) document deviations from good practice that may substantially affect the results.

  abstract = {Choice of a classification algorithm is generally based upon a number of factors, among which are availability of software, ease of use, and performance, measured here by overall classification accuracy. The maximum likelihood (ML) procedure is, for many users, the algorithm of choice because of its ready availability and the fact that it does not require an extended training process. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are now widely used by researchers, but their operational applications are hindered by the need for the user to specify the configuration of the network architecture and to provide values for a number of parameters, both of which affect performance. The ANN also requires an extended training phase. In the past few years, the use of decision trees (DTs) to classify remotely sensed data has increased. Proponents of the method claim that it has a number of advantages over the ML and ANN algorithms. The DT is computationally fast, make no statistical assumptions, and can handle data that are represented on different measurement scales. Software to implement DTs is readily available over the Internet. Pruning of DTs can make them smaller and more easily interpretable, while the use of boosting techniques can improve performance. In this study, separate test and training data sets from two different geographical areas and two different sensors\textemdash multispectral Landsat ETM+ and hyperspectral DAIS\textemdash are used to evaluate the performance of univariate and multivariate DTs for land cover classification. Factors considered are: the effects of variations in training data set size and of the dimensionality of the feature space, together with the impact of boosting, attribute selection measures, and pruning. The level of classification accuracy achieved by the DT is compared to results from back-propagating ANN and the ML classifiers. Our results indicate that the performance of the univariate DT is acceptably good in comparison with that of other classifiers, except with high-dimensional data. Classification accuracy increases linearly with training data set size to a limit of 300 pixels per class in this case. Multivariate DTs do not appear to perform better than univariate DTs. While boosting produces an increase in classification accuracy of between 3\% and 6\%, the use of attribute selection methods does not appear to be justified in terms of accuracy increases. However, neither the univariate DT nor the multivariate DT performed as well as the ANN or ML classifiers with high-dimensional data.},

  abstract = {The Sentinel-2 program provides the opportunity to monitor terrestrial ecosystems with a high temporal and spectral resolution. In this study, a multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data set was used to classify common tree species over a mature forest in central Sweden. The tree species to be classified were Norway spruce (Picea abies), Scots pine (Pinus silvestris), Hybrid larch (Larix \texttimes{} marschlinsii), Birch (Betula sp.) and Pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). Four Sentinel-2 images from spring (7 April and 27 May), summer (9 July) and fall (19 October) of 2017 were used along with the Random Forest (RF) classifier. A variable selection approach was implemented to find fewer and uncorrelated bands resulting in the best model for tree species identification. The final model resulting in the highest overall accuracy (88.2\%) came from using all bands from the four image dates. The single image that gave the most accurate classification result (80.5\%) was the late spring image (27 May); the 27 May image was always included in subsequent image combinations that gave the highest overall accuracy. The five tree species were classified with a user's accuracy ranging from 70.9\% to 95.6\%. Thirteen of the 40 bands were selected in a variable selection procedure and resulted in a model with only slightly lower accuracy (86.3\%) than that using all bands. Among the highest ranked bands were the red edge bands 2 and 3 as well as the narrow NIR (near-infrared) band 8a, all from the 27 May image, and SWIR (short-wave infrared) bands from all four image dates. This study shows that the red-edge bands and SWIR bands from Sentinel-2 are of importance, and confirms that spring and/or fall images capturing phenological differences between the species are most useful to tree species classification.},

Of 67,141 FIA plots available, 62,758 of these (93.5\%) were utilized at least once in imputation to 2,841,601,981 forested pixels in CONUS. Continuous high-resolution forest structure data at a national scale will be invaluable for analyzing carbon dynamics, habitat distributions, and fire effects.},

  abstract = {The paper presents a novel tree species classification approach based on an automated analysis of Sentine1-2 images, where deficient inventory data from an analysis area are available for reference. The procedure proposed involves clustering of one or several multispectral images of the area of interest taken in different seasons, with the subsequent assignment of a particular tree species class to each cluster by using sparse and imprecise inventory data. The analysis is performed only within the forest areas separated using the forest mask obtained from LiDAR scanning data. Classification results are tested against the ground truth prepared manually from remote sensing images or taken from the same kind of imprecise inventory data. An analysis of a sample area in Latvia for which the sparse inventory data was available was performed. Several clustering algorithms were compared, and it is shown that recently proposed Dynland clustering algorithm has advantages over the traditional k-means clustering. Identification of the most important 4 species was targeted, and it is shown that considerable classification accuracy, with a kappa coefficient up to 0.9 can be achieved in this case by the approach proposed. The proposed approach can be used within automatic workflows for estimation of forest microstand parameters from remote sensing data.},

  abstract = {Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a versatile cloud platform in which pixel-based (PB) and object-oriented (OO) Land Use\&ndash;Land Cover (LULC) classification approaches can be implemented, thanks to the availability of the many state-of-art functions comprising various Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. OO approaches, including both object segmentation and object textural analysis, are still not common in the GEE environment, probably due to the difficulties existing in concatenating the proper functions, and in tuning the various parameters to overcome the GEE computational limits. In this context, this work is aimed at developing and testing an OO classification approach combining the Simple Non-Iterative Clustering (SNIC) algorithm to identify spatial clusters, the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) to calculate cluster textural indices, and two ML algorithms (Random Forest (RF) or Support Vector Machine (SVM)) to perform the final classification. A Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is applied to the main seven GLCM indices to synthesize in one band the textural information used for the OO classification. The proposed approach is implemented in a user-friendly, freely available GEE code useful to perform the OO classification, tuning various parameters (e.g., choose the input bands, select the classification algorithm, test various segmentation scales) and compare it with a PB approach. The accuracy of OO and PB classifications can be assessed both visually and through two confusion matrices that can be used to calculate the relevant statistics (producer\&rsquo;s, user\&rsquo;s, overall accuracy (OA)). The proposed methodology was broadly tested in a 154 km2 study area, located in the Lake Trasimeno area (central Italy), using Landsat 8 (L8), Sentinel 2 (S2), and PlanetScope (PS) data. The area was selected considering its complex LULC mosaic mainly composed of artificial surfaces, annual and permanent crops, small lakes, and wooded areas. In the study area, the various tests produced interesting results on the different datasets (OA: PB RF (L8 = 72.7\%, S2 = 82\%, PS = 74.2), PB SVM (L8 = 79.1\%, S2 = 80.2\%, PS = 74.8\%), OO RF (L8 = 64\%, S2 = 89.3\%, PS = 77.9), OO SVM (L8 = 70.4, S2 = 86.9\%, PS = 73.9)). The broad code application demonstrated very good reliability of the whole process, even though the OO classification process resulted, sometimes, too demanding on higher resolution data, considering the available computational GEE resources.},

  abstract = {We use freely available Sentinel-2 data and forest inventory data to evaluate the potential of different machine-learning approaches to classify tree species in two forest regions in Bavaria, Germany. Atmospheric correction was applied to the level 1C data, resulting in true surface reflectance or bottom of atmosphere (BOA) output. We developed a semiautomatic workflow for the classification of deciduous (mainly spruce trees), beech and oak trees by evaluating different classification algorithms (object- and pixel-based) in an architecture optimized for distributed processing. A hierarchical approach was used to evaluate different band combinations and algorithms (Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF)) for the separation of broad-leaved vs. coniferous trees. The Ebersberger forest was the main project region and the Freisinger forest was used in a transferability study. Accuracy assessment and training of the algorithms was based on inventory data, validation was conducted using an independent dataset. A confusion matrix, with User\textasciiacute s and Producer\textasciiacute s Accuracies, as well as Overall Accuracies, was created for all analyses. In total, we tested 16 different classification setups for coniferous vs. broad-leaved trees, achieving the best performance of 97\% for an object-based multitemporal SVM approach using only band 8 from three scenes (May, August and September). For the separation of beech and oak trees we evaluated 54 different setups, the best result achieved an accuracy of 91\% for an object-based, SVM, multitemporal approach using bands 8, 2 and 3 of the May scene for segmentation and all principal components of the August scene for classification. The transferability of the model was tested for the Freisinger forest and showed similar results. This project points out that Sentinel-2 had only marginally worse results than comparable commercial high-resolution satellite sensors and is well-suited for forest analysis on a tree-stand level.},

  abstract = {Interest in knowing more about the Earth's land cover and how it has changed over time motivated the mission and sensor design of early terrestrial remote sensing systems. Rapid developments in computer hardware and software in the last four decades have greatly increased the capacity for satellite data acquisition, downlink, dissemination, and end user science and applications. In 1992, Townshend reviewed the state of land cover mapping using Earth observation data at a pivotal point in time and in the context of years of research and practical experience with Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) High Resolution Visible (HRV) and Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data, demonstrating the opportunities and information content possible with increased spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. Townshend characterized the state-of-the-art for land cover at that time, identified trends, and shared insights on research directions. Now, on the 25th anniversary of Townshend's important work, given numerous advances and emerging trends, we revisit the status of land cover mapping with Earth observation data. We posit that a new era of land cover analysis \textendash{} Land Cover 2.0 \textendash{} has emerged, enabled by free and open access data, analysis ready data, high performance computing, and rapidly developing data processing and analysis capabilities. Herein we characterize this new era in land cover information, highlighting institutional, computational, as well as theoretical developments that have occurred over the past 25 years, identifying the key issues and opportunities that have emerged. We conclude that Land Cover 2.0 offers efficiencies in information generation that will result in a proliferation of land cover products, reinforcing the need for transparency regarding the input data and algorithms used as well as adoption, implementation, and communication of rigorous accuracy assessment protocols. Further, land cover and land change assessments are no longer independent activities. Knowledge of land change is available to inform and enrich land cover generation.},
